# Portfolio-credit-risk-models

This repository collects material for a university project on **portfolio credit risk models** in the context of risk management and Basel regulation.

## Project Overview

The goal is to study and compare different approaches to measuring the credit risk of **loan and bond portfolios**, with a focus on:

- Top-down vs. bottom-up models  
- Default-mode vs. mark-to-market models  
- Structural vs. reduced-form (intensity) models  
- Conditional vs. unconditional portfolio loss models  
- The Basel II/III IRB (Vasicek one-factor) framework for regulatory capital
